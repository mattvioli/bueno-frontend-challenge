# TODO

As time constraints, this is not 100% what I would like it to be.
Here is a list of things still to do.

1. Write unit tests for utils functions
2. Write unit tests to ensure buttons work/don't get broken
3. PokemonTable component is to big, split into Head and Body components
4. Replace snapshot tests with visual regression test
